We are actively working on updating the notes for this section.

Q: Please walk us through typical day at your work.

A: As part of my day-to-day work I start with daily standup, we follow agile methodology where we update previous days work, If i am blocked then I explain I'm blocked for xyz reason and seeking help from someone & would get it released. Post that I head to JIRA and check for tasks assigned to me, I start working priority basis and there would be few adhoc requests as well to prioritize. 
Tasks that we work usually are terraform. (Note: try to focus on the job skills mentioned on the JD) I'm one of the SME and by EOD I would update JIRA tracker as other devops engineers might reference the ticket so everything is updated in it.
Also, most of the time in afternoons we would have meetings with other developers, architect, and i try to actively participate in it. This is how my typical day looks. 
Make sure to blend the tools in your statement.
